# [I HAVE NO MOUTH, AND I MUST SCREAM](https://wjccschools.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/I-Have-No-Mouth-But-I-Must-Scream-by-Harlan-Ellison.pdf).

8 years experience in web development. Hardcore PHP developer since 2015, moved on to Ruby on Rails in 2019. I have jumped from one project to another, one company to another, always building new tools for companies and their users. I've had my own projects here and there.

- 🔭 Currently working on [Prycely](https://prycely.com), a group savings platform to help you set financial goals and work towards hitting them. The original version was the [GroupGoals app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.berjis.groupgoals&hl=en&gl=US) which I (have probably) made public.

- 🌱 Actively learning game development with Unreal Engine.

I have been invloved in multiple projects and while some are internal company stuff I can't display here, here are some public ones; maybe you can find one you've been looking for.
