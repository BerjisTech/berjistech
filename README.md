<summary>A bit about me</summary>
8 years experience in web development. Hardcore PHP developer since 2015, moved on to Ruby on Rails in 2019. I have jumped from one project to another, one company to another, always building new tools for companies and their users. I've had my own projects here and there.
- ðŸ”­ Currently working on [Prycely](https://prycely.com), a group savings platform to help you set financial goals and work towards hitting them. The original version was the [GroupGoals app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.berjis.groupgoals&hl=en&gl=US) which I (have probably) made public.

- ðŸŒ± Actively learning game development with Unreal Engine.

I have been invloved in multiple projects and while some are internal company stuff I can't display here, here are some public ones; maybe you can find one you've been looking for.

**Led a 25 member dev team.**

An older version of this can be found [here](https://github.com/BerjisTech/shopify-stripe-profitwell-chartmogul-metrics), the code is bad so don't use it for any official work
