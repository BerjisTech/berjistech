### Ahem,

Hello.

8 years experience in web development. I was a hardcore PHP developer since 2015 but I moved on to the gem that is Ruby on Rails in 2019 and struck with it since then. Throughout this time I have jumped from one project to another, one company to another, always building new tools for companies and their users. I've had my own projects here and there.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Prycely](https://prycely.com), a group savings platform to help you set financial goals and work towards hitting them. The original version was the [GroupGoals app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.berjis.groupgoals&hl=en&gl=US) which I (have probably) made public.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning game development with Unreal Engine and I have reasons to believe that C++ doesn't like me. Howver hard this relationship with C++ maybe, I'll make it work. Looking forward to many anniversaries.

I have been invloved in multiple projects and while some are internal company stuff I can't display here, here are some public ones; maybe you can find one you've been looking for.

**Opensource contribution**

I may or may not have led a 25 member dev team. I got most of my management skills here but I can definitely work on it more.

Oh, almost forgot about skills. They're just the typical web dev skills you see everywhere, HTML, CSS, JS. You can break dow the JS one to React and JQuery seeing that I dropped PHP, whose to say I won't drop these too. I prefer Bootstrap and my custom CSS.

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, SCSS, SAAS, JS
- Frontend Frameworks and libraries: JQuery, Bootstrap, React
- Backend: Ruby, PHP
- Backend Frameworks: Rails, Laravel, Codeigniter
- Systems: Linux
- Servers: Apache, Nginx
- Databases: Postgresql, MySqli
- Things I'm not sure what to cal: Phussion Passenger, Capistrano

Is linux a skill, because if yes, then I AM A LINUX USER.

- âš¡ Fun fact: In my second year of campus I had to choose between affording food/rent and paying school fees. Well, I did what anyone with a rational brain would do. **I chose food**. So, yeah, I have no certificates of any kind *but my heart is in the right placeðŸ˜…ðŸ¥´*.
